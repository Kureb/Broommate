# Broommate
A mobisocial context-aware application to help future families to deal with coordination efforts.


## What ?
Broommate is an Android application created for a student contest at the University of Oulu (Finland) in order to validate knowledge from Mobile & Social Computing courses.
> The objective of this project is to create an application that is both mobile and social, context-aware to help future families to deal with coordination efforts.

## Focus
We defined two types of people who could need our application, families and roommates. Both of these categories are basically sharing the same place and need to improve their coordination efforts.
We do think that the most asked questions in a shared flat can fit in two categories like the following :
* **Location**: Is _[name]_ at home? Do you know where is _[name]_? 
* **Tasks**: Do you know if _[name]_ bought some milk? I wonder if _[name]_ cleaned the bathroom.

Broommate is focused on these two categories.
